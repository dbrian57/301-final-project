# 301-final-project
This is TEAM GET's 301 final project

# Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

- Group Members:
  - Lauren M.
  - Rey M.
  - Andres M. 
  - Dan B.

## Describe at least:

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
  - Rey: Can keep other members informed of status and upcoming tasks, citing documentation
  - Andres: Attention to detail, efficient without overlooking things
  - Lauren: Quick learner, motivating/optimistic
  - Dan: Documentation, debugging/problem solving skills
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
  - Rey: Can take initiative to ensure team cohesion and staying on-task (The cat herder!)
  - Andres: Attention to detail is useful for debugging
  - Lauren: Capable of integrating new APIs or technologies not yet taught or deeply covered in class
  - Dan: Can leverage documentation skills where necessary, experience documenting APIs
- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Rey: Organization/planning (e.g. time-boxing)
  - Andres: Collaboration/team-based work
  - Lauren: Organization/planning (e.g. prioritizing tasks)
  - Dan: Organization/time management; writing more original code from scratch
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
(NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.)
  - By utilizing a project-management framework such as Trello and by having at least a morning standup, and others as needed, we will ensure that all our group members are caught-up with the current status of the project.  We will also implement an end-of-day meeting. All of these will help ensure that everyone's voices are heard.

## Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

### Describe at least:

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  - Conflicts are to be addressed in a timely manner via a group meeting to discuss the issue in a judgement-free zone.  Group members should contribute timely and honest feedback to help prevent conflicts before they arise.  If necessary, we will ask a TA or our instructor to help mediate. 
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
  - By frequently re-evaluating our relative workloads/contributions, we will try to prevent this problem before it occurs.  If this issue arises, it will be addressed swiftly.   
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - By maintaining an empathetic outlook for our fellow group members, we will promise to be patient with each other and value each other's relative contributions.  We all come from different backgrounds but are all here to learn and contribute. If necessary, we can seek further advice from our instructors. 
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - In a timely manner and with kindness. 
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  - As stated above, we will contact a TA or our instructor. 

## Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

### Describe at least:

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  - 9 AM - 6PM guaranteed, beyond that optional per group member
- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  - Slack, Remo (Zoom/Email as a backup)
How often will you take breaks?
  - 10 minutes at the top of the hour, more as necessary 
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Our group will have an emergency meeting to re-evaluate our goals and priorities. 
- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  - Via Slack or Remo.  This is up to the individual group members. 
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  - Our daily meetings will give time for everyone to speak and we will be mindful of group members who may be speaking up less.  We will promise to listen empathetically to our group members. 
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  - We will be kind and empathetic and follow the [Code Fellows Code of Conduct](http://codefellows.github.io/code-of-conduct/). 

## Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

## Describe at least:

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  - We will use a project management tool. 

- What project management tool will be used?
  - GitHub Projects

## Presentation Deck
Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

Link to the shared doc in your project plan.

### Schedule your practice session

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

- Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
- When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
- Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

Temporary practice dates:  March 9 and March 10

### Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  - The source code
  - Any assets we create (icons)
  - Our project management tool
- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  - Via GitHub collaborators
- What is your Git flow?
  - After breaking out to do either individual or pair programming tasks on daily branches, we will later get together for daily "merge parties" where we, as a group, merge our branches into main and work through any merge conflicts. 
- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
- How many people must review a PR?
  - 2 out of 3 other group members
- Who merges PRs?
  - The author
- How often will you merge?
  - Daily is our target, more as necessary at natural break-points
How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
  - Via Remo or Slack
